# Solidity Semgrep Rules

This repo contains a collection of experimental Semgrep rules for Solidity smart contracts. Rules  to help identify common patterns, security vulnerabilities, and code quality issues in Solidity codebases.

**Note**: These rules are experimental and may not be highly efficient or cover all edge cases. They are primarily intended for exploration, learning, and early-stage detection.
