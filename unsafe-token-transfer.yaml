    severity: WARNING
    message: >
      Using `transfer()` or `transferFrom()` with tokens  can be unsafe because some tokens may not adhere to the ERC20 standard strictly. Prefer using OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library which provides safe wrappers around these methods to handle tokens that don't conform to the standard.
    patterns:
      - pattern-either: 
        - pattern: $TOKEN.transfer(...)
        - pattern: $TOKEN.transferFrom(...)
